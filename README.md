# your-reads

A MERN stack app that is built using TypeScript.

I have used Google oauth 2.0 to authenticate users. 

I have used Google Books api to search for books. A user can then add books to any of the three sections such as 'read', 'reading', or 'shelf'. In the reading section, a user can also add notes for every book.
